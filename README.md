This project creates a Christmas Light effect using 6 LEDs connected to an Arduino Uno.
Each LED turns on and off in sequence using programmed delays. The circuit is built
using Arduino Uno R3, a breadboard, resistors, and jumper wires. The code is written
in Arduino C++ and tested through Tinkercad Simulation.
